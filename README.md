### Installation

Download the project from github to your desktop:

  - **With Git** :

      **1.** Click the green button labeled &nbsp;`Code`</br>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="assets/images/Button-Position.png" width="300px;" /></br>
      
      **2.** Copy the URL of the repository</br>
      
      **3.** Next, on your local machine, open your bash shell and change your current working directory to the location where you would like to clone your repository
      ```shell
      cd "path-to-your-folder"
      ```
      
      **4.** Once you have navigated to the directory where you want to put your repository, you can use
      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/MouhammadAyoub/CVs-repository.git
      ```
      
      **5.** When you run `git clone https://github.com/MouhammadAyoub/CVs-repository.git`, You should see output like
      ```shell
      Cloning into 'test-repo'...
      remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
      remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
      remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
      Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), done.
      Checking connectivity... done.
      ```
      </br>
      
  - **Without Git** :
      When downloading materials to your laptop, it is easiest to download the entire repository.
      
      **1.** Click on the green `Code` button, then download the repository as a ZIP file</br>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="assets/images/Download-Zip.png" width="350px;" /></br>
      
      **2.** Find the downloaded .zip file on your computer, likely in your Downloads folder</br>
      
      **3.** Unzip it, this will create a folder named after the GitHub repository</br></br>

  - **Steps you must do to make the app work properly** :
      
      **1.** Change the server name of the `ConnectionStrings` attribute in the `appsetting.json` file</br>
      
      <img src="assets/images/My-Connection-String.png" /></br>
      
      **2.** Open the `package manager console`</br>
      
      <img src="assets/images/Package-Manager-Console.png" width="500px" /></br>
      
      **3.** Run the `update-database` command
